# Dynamic Background Generator

Dynamic Background Generator is a user-friendly tool that automatically changes the background color based on the dominant colors in an uploaded image. It also generates a color palette extracted from the image, making it a perfect utility for designers, developers, and creatives looking for aesthetic consistency. This project is inspired by the gradient background generated functionality I found in spoitify.
